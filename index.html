<!--pluralsight.com course: Deborah Kurata AngularJS Line of Business Applications -->
<!-- 1-Intro: 1) Key factors in building line of business application - DATA IS CRITICAL ASSET (LOTS of data need to filter/display; lots data fields; data integrity significant; need data visualization)   -->
<!-- 1-Intro: 1) cont'd need techniques for saving partially completed data (in case you enter data, then open another browser, don't want to lose data you entered  -->
<!-- 1-Intro: 2) Steps to build Angular line of business application: 1-Business requirements(application features, design considerations, architecture 2-Layout and Navigation (page layout(view), style(bootstrap), navigation(routing) 3-Data Access (retrieving data, saving data) 4-Data Entry Forms (form layout, validation, submittal) 5-Business Logic (Services which you can use and reuse in application 6-Data Visualization or Analytics (charts) and topics that are cross-cutting over all 6 steps: Exception handling, unit testing and security -->
<!-- 1-Intro: 3) Course Outline: 1-Building First Page 2-Accessing Data 3-Routing to Multiple pages 4-Building Data Entry forms 5-Performing Validation 6-Defining Business Logic in Service 7-Visualizing Data with Charts 8-Exception Handling 9-Unit Testing,Security-->
<!-- 2-Building First Page: 1) Objectives 1-Turn business requirements into a View, Model and Controller 2-Organize Project Structure for app 3-Build the View using directives 4-Define the Module for app 5-Build Controller 6-Define the Model 7-Implement the Methods 8-Style View with bootstrap  -->
<!-- 2-Building First Page: 2) Define the VIEW User stories:  browse list of products, see product images, select product to view and edit product details led to a MOCKUP of "Product List View"-->
<!-- 2-Building First Page: 3) Define the MODEL Angular app - data often defined in JSON; products here are in array (in [] ) and each product in curly braces within array; data defined as name/value pairs separated by colons - e.g. "productId":1  so create a Product Model in JSON that identifies all the key/value pairs for ONE PRODUCT-->
<!-- 2-Building First Page: 4) Define the CONTROLLER - Product List Controller; note Controller defines MODEL (list of DATA-sometimes referred to as view model) (retrieve product data by calling backend web service) and CODE for actions in the VIEW (e.g. Hide/show Images - hiding can improve performance by not downloading all the image files  -->
<!-- 2-Building First Page: 5) Organizing Project Structure - this course uses the "by feature" approach - directories organized around directory features; "common" directory contains code common to all parts of application; js directory is for only external js files, like angular.js; index.html contains references to js and css files and is launching point for product management application; she's using Webstorm IDE  -->
<!-- 2-Building First Page: 6) create barebones index.html (add ng-app to body tag, angular.js script note ng-app is a directive that identifies the application as an angular app-->
<!-- 2-Building First Page: 7) open up dev tools - Network will see browser first fetches the index.html and then retrieves and executes angular.js -->
<!-- 2-Building First Page: 8) distinction TEMPLATE is HTML (actual code) that defines visual elements and directives VIEW is the loaded and rendered template (the generated page)- also called "live template" instructor uses VIEW in general way that refers to BOTH template and View-->

Why? WITHOUT ng-src app tries to load image BEFORE Angular can evaluate the binding expression - can look in dev tools - Network to see images NOW come down NEXT go to app.js
                        style="width:50px;margin:2px"  2-Building First Page: 13) added style code
